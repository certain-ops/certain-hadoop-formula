# This formula requires an SDB store that is common to all boxes. Initialization
# of the hadoop cluster requires dynamic configuration and requires each node
# the cluster to know where the managers are. These values are kept in SDB. 
#
# The following pillar configures a memcached SDB store via the Salt formula
# https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/salt-formula
